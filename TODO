You create an account, and pass in the identity it should be joined with.
If no identity is passed in, you get a new one.

When you update an account, you can pass in a new identity.
If there is an old identity, this one gets orphaned.

Identity knows how to orphan itself (create entry in orphan table, then nuke original)
