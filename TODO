* territory
    has one or more apps for implemented providers
    each app is configured (provider, name, api_key, secret, endpoints, etc)

* identity (a human or robot)
    territories do not share these
    has a <provider>_uid for each provider we have
    has a (shadow) profile for each provider
    has a byline (byline_name, byline_url, byline_image) which is synthetic
    - defaults to first authenticated provider/application

* profile
    lives in redis
    - refactor pieces that end up being used a lot.
    - followers might need to be a separate entry in Redis, not directly on the Person

* authentication
    identities have zero or many authentications
    - provider, token, secret
